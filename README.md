  # DiscoutCodeApp

  Hi, if you would like to utilize the Client. just run the client side by side by another VS. only 2 options. 1 is to generate and 2 is to use code. 
Please do note that the results somtimes overlaps with the prints due to the results being async in nature. just put in your values and have fun. Thanks :)
